# Film Query App

## Description
This app allows a user to query a database of imaginary films by either ID or keyword. The app will return various results depending on input. The program continues to expect user input until the user chooses to exit.

## Technologies Used
- Java, Eclipse IDE
- SQL/MySQL
- Maven
- git/github

## Lessons Learned
- use @Override
- remember to do null checks before trying to do things with objects!

## To do...
- right now the actor list is generated with a separate query. Should this be all one query?
